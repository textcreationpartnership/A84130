            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ſublime Argument, touching <hi>the unitie of the God-head, and the Trinitie of the Perſons,</hi> is of that high concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it obligeth Chriſtians to lay themſelvs out to the uttermoſt in the ſearch of the means in the which it hath pleaſed the Lord to reveal himſelf, that wee might have right apprehenſions of him; partly, becauſe it is very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and attended with ſad conſequences to have erroneous conceptions in this to-bee-adored ſubject: and partly, becauſe no ſubordinate truths can bee more profitably learned, whether wee reſpect the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of our judgments, the reformation of our lives, or our ſound conſolation in every condition.</p>
            <p>In this licentious age, wherein Hereſies, with more boldneſs (the more is the pitie) are not onely private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vented, but printed, and expoſed to publick view, then in former ages, whereby many unwary and ungrounded Readers are infected with leproſie in
<pb facs="tcp:114590:3"/> their heads, and their judgments are corrupted, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wicked phancies, for want of humilitie, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg in Scripture, Arts and Tongues, and due reſpect to the word of God, and the teſtimonie of ancient and modern Divines, have been broached, ſo hath <hi>the fundamentall Article touching the Deitie of the holy Ghoſt</hi> been queſtioned, yea plainly contradicted.</p>
            <p>Many months paſſed before I had a ſight of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Bidle</hi>'s <hi>abhorred lines,</hi> nor did I ſo much as deſire to read them; but when I heard by the relation of a very learned man, and of much obſervation touching theſe times, that thoſe twelve Reaſons did a great deal of hurt, I then uſed the means to get a ſight of the Book, and I ſaw it was <hi>Sophiſtically penned, and plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly contrived to do much miſchief;</hi> and when I could not hear that any of the learned, which have far better abilities, more leaſure, and encouraging accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions then I have, would ſpend their precious time in convincing this Adverſarie of God, I reſolved, by the grace of the Spirit of God, to vindicate what lie's in mee his honor, in <hi>ſhewing partly the weakneſs, partly the blaſphemie of his twelve Reaſons,</hi> to ſhew him, if it may bee, the danger of his Hereſie, and to clear the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Scriptures from his Sophiſtrie, and to hold forth that little light which the bleſſed Spirit hath freely imparted to mee, to the bettering of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
<pb facs="tcp:114590:3"/> of the ſimple Readers.</p>
            <p>There have been many erroneous opinions, no fewer then ſix in my knowledg, (and 'tis not unlike but there are many more) touching the bleſſed Spirit, the holy Ghoſt; it is not fit, nor ſafe for mee to ſet down a Catalogue of them, leſt unawares (which is far from my intention) ſom vain and unſound Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in theſe unſettled daies ſhould take an occaſion to err from the beaten way of truth; and others, which have tender conſciences, ſhould bee offended with the ſtinch of theſe rotten Hereſies, when they are preſented to them: yet neceſſary it is, that I ſhould ſet down my Adverſaries <hi>tenet,</hi> that the Reader may know it, and that I may more punctually addreſs myſelf to anſwer him; and this hee hold's, <hi>That the holy Ghoſt is a creature, a finite perſon, the prime and chief of all the good Angels, as the Divel by an unhappy excellencie is called the chief of all the evill Spirits:</hi> An ancient Hereſie this is in the Church of Chriſt condemned both by the ſingle teſtimonie of many famous Doctors, and by a generall Synod at Conſtantinople, which hath been alwaies honored, and was held by the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the firſt, more then twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and threeſcore years ago.</p>
            <p>O bleſſed God! bee not angry with mee, I beſeech thee, who am but ſinfull duſt and aſhes, for adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing
<pb facs="tcp:114590:4"/> to ſpeak of thy glorious Majeſtie. Pardon, I humbly pray, for my Saviors ſake, all my ſinfull ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of thine unconceivable Greatneſs, accept graciouſly my ſincere intentions to promote thy glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and guide mee (O my God!) that I may alwaies, as a weak and ſinfull creature ought to do, both think, and ſpeak, and write of thy glorious Majeſtie with holy fear and lowly reverence, and inſtruct mee, O thou bleſſed Spirit of Truth, that I may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily untie the Sophiſtical knots of carnal and humane reaſon, which in <hi>pretence</hi> are grounded on the truth of thy Word, and yet there is no <hi>truth</hi> in them, nor any <hi>divine word</hi> for them: And enable mee to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thy Greatneſs againſt a <hi>wretched man,</hi> which dare's ſtand up, and both boldly and publickly argue againſt thine ever to bee adored Deitie.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is clear; for albeit the name of God bee given to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. 6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 7. and to Magiſtrates, they are Gods to whom the Word of God came, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82. 7. that is, to whom by divine vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation the office of Magiſtracie is committed; yet either this is not ſpoken in the ſingular number, <hi>I ſaid yee are Gods,</hi> whereas the true God without contradiction is but <hi>one;</hi> or, when it is ſpoken ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly, it is not without limitation, <hi>Moſes, I have made thee a God to Pharaoh, Exod.</hi> 7. 1. Every man may readily conceive that a made God is is not a true God; or with ſuch an affixed limitation that a ſimple man can hardly miſtake: <hi>I have ſaid yee are Gods,</hi> yet they are but mortal Gods; for as is threatned there, <hi>They muſt die like mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal men;</hi> but the true God is immortal. So that in all the Scriptures wee ſhall not finde the names of God aſſcribed to any creatures with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>addition, limitation,</hi> or <hi>correction of ſpeech,</hi> nor is this denied by the Adverſarie.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved, <hi>firſt,</hi> more obſcurely, Gen. 1. 1. <hi>God creäted:</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:114590:5"/> A word not of the ſingular, or dual, but plural number, and that is alſo with a word of the ſingular number. God creäted, becauſe God is but one in nature, but in regard of the manner of beeing there are three Perſons. And in verſe 26. of the ſame Chapter, God ſaith, <hi>Let <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s make man after Our image,</hi> that is, in the image of the holy Trinitie: theſe, and many like to theſe are alledged out of the old Teſtament, and juſtified to bee pertinent to prove this cauſe againſt the exceptions of ſuch as have oppoſed them; and the rather is the phraſe to bee marked, becauſe, as is obſerved, it is not ſaid, one, <hi>Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him unus,</hi> as one, <hi>Jehovah unus,</hi> in all the Scripture. <hi>W. in</hi> 1. <hi>praec. Decal.</hi> but becauſe they meet with contradiction of learned friends, I paſs them over. <hi>Secondly,</hi> and more particularly, King <hi>David</hi> in his laſt words ſaith, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord ſpake by mee, and his word was in my tongue,</hi> 2 Sam. 23. 2. and then verſe 3. by way of explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hee add's, <hi>the God of Iſraël ſaid, the rock of Iſraël ſpake to mee.</hi> And yet more fully, Eſa. 6. 3. that Perſon that is called the Lord of hoſts, and after that, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Lord, which is the proper name of God, ver. 9. is by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> an infallible Interpreter, expounded of the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Well ſpake the holy Ghoſt by Eſaias the Prophet unto our Fathers,</hi> Act. 28. 25. <hi>hearing yee ſhall hear, and not underſtand—</hi>and this is further proved, becauſe what God promiſed <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. 12. I will dwell in them, and walk in them, that is verified of all faithful Chriſtians, when the holy Ghoſt dwell's in them; hence are they called the Temples of God, and that is expounded by the holy Ghoſts dwelling in them, 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 3. 16. and 1. 6. 20. 19. what can bee more plain? The virtue of God is never ſeparated from his Eſſence. God is there where hee work's, and Gods working in a creature, and dwelling in them differ much. God work's in all things, and is with them according to his eſſence, preſence and power, but hee work's in his own and dwell's in them, as in his Temple, according to his ſingular and gracious preſence. <label type="milestone">

How came <hi>Peter</hi> to know this lie of <hi>Ananias?</hi> It's not a man, not a creature that can ſearch the heart, was it not then God that revealed this ſin and the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Ananias</hi> and of his wife to <hi>Peter,</hi> even the bleſſed Spirit that enlightned, ſanctified and enriched him with extraordinary gifts?

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114590:7"/> of the text, had found out a fault in our common tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whereof the Authors out of their ignorance or inadvertencie took no notice; if ſo hee think's hee is utterly miſtaken: for all tranſlators, ancient and of later days, had the text before their eyes, and ſaw the difference which is here noted by this Author, and yet did purpoſely tranſlate the words, <hi>thou haſt lied to the holy Ghoſt,</hi> as holding forth the genuine meaning of the Spirit of God, ſom excepted, which yet, for the point of controverſie in hand proved out of this very Scripture, are profeſſed Adverſaries to you. <hi>Beza,</hi> after hee had rendred the words <hi>to deceive,</hi> or <hi>mock;</hi> i. e. endeavor to deceive the holy Ghoſt, (I might add what others ſay) hee retract's and go's in the ſteps of common tranſlators.

                  </gap>, and ſo have the Syrian and Arabian Interpreters read it. Laſtly, becauſe this interpretation which is followed by <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> to ſay, <hi>they coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited the holy Ghoſt,</hi> ſeem's to mee not to bee full. They were indeed notorious hypocrits, but <hi>Peter</hi> by the ſequele accuſeth them of a far higher crime, that when, as by the motion of the Spirit, they had ſold a parcel of ground, and conſecrated it to the Church, they afterward kept back a part thereof, as if in that caſe they had not to deal with God, but with men, which could not diſcover this their ſacriledg, and ſo they are in this regard ſaid to tempt the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God.</p>
               <p>Further, were it granted that your tranſlation were ſound, and that the words ought to bee ſo interpreted, as you have don, this neither hinder's us, nor further's you; none ever dreamed by the common tranſlation to correct the meaning of the text, that they might have an Argument thence to confute the Adverſaries of the holy Ghoſt; hee needeth not our lie to defend his cauſe. But the ſtrength of the Argument is not from the words ſingly taken, ver. 3. but from them, and the explication of them in the fourth and ninth verſes, you counterfeit the holy Ghoſt to bee the Author of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114590:8"/> this fact, and this is expounded to bee a lying to God, <hi>viz.</hi> to God the holy Ghoſt whom you have counterfeited, hee ſpeaking in us, and diſcovering this hypocriſie of your heart which you litle dreamed off. And your expoſition of the words, as they ſtand in your Book, is of that nature, that albeit I have perpended it as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly as I can, yet do I conceive nothing in it, but I may readily ſubſcribe to it; I am ſure it nothing croſſeth the Argument.

               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is not denied by the Adverſarie, and is evident of it ſelf: and ſtrange it is to mee that any learned men, which do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Deitie of the holy Ghoſt, ſhould avouch, as they do, that there is neither precept to worſhip him, nor any clear example in the Word that hee was worſhipped. 'Tis a certain rule, the ſacred Perſons of the Trinitie which are undivided in nature, muſt bee likewiſe undivided in worſhip: for any one to ſay the holy Ghoſt is God, and with the ſame breath to profeſs their doubting whether hee is to bee worſhipped, is to ſpeak contradictions; and 'tis all one as to acknowledg a King, and to deny him honor, and this is to make him a titular King, and in truth no King at all.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved thus: the holy Angels of God do worſhip him, they worſhipped the Lord of hoſts. Eſa. 6. 3. <hi>Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hoſts.</hi> Heb. 1. 6. Whether the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> underſtood this myſterie or not, 'tis not material to the point in hand, nor whether their thrice chanting out <hi>holy,</hi> implied the ſacred Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Yet why might not that bee intended? But the Angels beeing intellectual ſubſtances worſhipped they knew what, and beeing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in holineſs, they onely worſhipped a fit object of worſhip, and had they, or ſinful men worſhipped the higheſt creature with religious adoration, would not hee, as the Angel in the revelation, have rejected it, and ſaid, See you do it not? I am your fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant? but the Angels worſhipped the holy Ghoſt. I prove, the bleſſed Apoſtle and irrefragable Interpreter inform's us, that the Lord of hoſts who put words into the mouth of <hi>Eſay</hi> was the holy Ghoſt, Act. 28. 25. <hi>Well ſaid the holy Ghoſt by Eſaiah the Prophet:</hi> and as the Son of God is directly prayed unto, <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> ſaid <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:114590:8"/> that bleſſed martyr, <hi>receive my Spirit,</hi> Acts 7. <hi>Lord Jeſus com quickly,</hi> Apocal. 22. So is likewiſe the holy Spirit, <hi>Awake thou North-winde, and com thou South, blow upon my garden, that the Spices thereof may flow out.</hi> O bleſſed Spirit breathe into my heart, that by the love of God and my neighbor it may ſend forth a ſweet ſavor, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 16. The bleſſed Spirit of God is compared to the winde, that as <hi>the winde blow's where it liſt's,</hi> ſo doth the Spirit of God blow where hee will, regenerat's whom hee pleaſeth, <hi>John</hi> 3. 8. And to this intent it is that S. <hi>John</hi> prayeth, <hi>grace and peace,</hi> not onely from God the Father and from Jeſus Chriſt, but alſo <hi>from the ſeven Spirits,</hi> Apocal. 1. 4. The Spirit is but one in nature, but it is ſaid to bee <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> that is, <hi>manifold,</hi> in regard of the diſtribution of many gifts which are from the Spirit, and more plainly 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 13. 13. <hi>The grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the love of God, and the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the holy Ghoſt bee with you all.</hi> And this Argument is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> as I have ſhewed in anſwer to your thirteenth Argument, and by <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> at the end <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>Paedag.</hi> uſed in the ancient Liturgies, and practiſed by the reformed Churches. <hi>Sancta Trinitas miſerere,</hi> O holy Trinitie have mercie.

I ſhut up this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the words of our Savior, Matth. 28. 19. <hi>Go and baptize all Nations in the Name of the Father, the Son, and holy Ghoſt:</hi> to bee ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized into the Name of the Father, Son and, holy Ghoſt, is to bee obliged to the Faith, Worſhip, and Obedience of God the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt.</p>

You add, <hi>Thus all the Iſraëlites were baptized into Moſes,</hi> 1 Corinth. 10. 2.</p>

                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> it is not ſaid 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 10. 2. that the Iſraëlites were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized into the Name of the Father, Son of God, and <hi>Moſes,</hi> which would have been a ſeeming advantage to you, but yet not
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114590:9"/> forcible enough to have ſhielded you from the dint of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> the Baptiſm into which the Iſraëlites were baptized, was not ſuch a Sacrament as ours of Baptiſm is; it was not a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Sacrament of the Covenant of Grace appertaining to eternal life, as our Baptiſm is: their paſſing through the Sea, and under the Cloud was don without ſprinkling them with, or dipping them in water, and did ſeal up, and evidently confirm that <hi>Moſes</hi> was by the Lord deputed to bee a Guid and a Leader of his people, whoſe Miniſterie was not fully ſpiritual, but 'tis termed carnal. God made choice of him to bee a happy inſtrument to deliver them out of bondage. Now ſuch as the deliverance is, ſuch is the Baptiſm; but conſider wee their paſſing through the red Sea, and by the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the Cloud, as types and figures of the benefits which wee receive from Chriſt our true and ſpiritual Mediator; for ſervitude in Egypt was a type of ſpiritual ſervitude under the power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and ſin: and deliverance out of Egypt was a type of our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from the ſnares of the devil, and the commanding power of our own ſins: In this regard it's denied that they were baptized into <hi>Moſes;</hi> hence is it ſaid that ſom were baptized into the Baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi> Act. 19. 2. but they are not ſaid to bee baptized into <hi>John;</hi> the reaſon is, becauſe the Miniſterie of <hi>John</hi> was meerly ſpiritual, and not carnal. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth take it as a very abſurd thing to bee abhorred of Chriſtians to bee baptized into the name of any man. 1 Corinth. 1. 13, 15. <hi>were yee baptized into the name of Paul?</hi> and yet would hee bee acknowledged to bee their Guid, and Doctor, and a Father, who by his Miniſterie begot them through the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 4. 15.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> this will further appear, if wee do conſider the uſe and the end of Baptiſm; it is a ſign and a ſeal of the new Covenant, the Covenant of Grace, which is ſignified and ratified thereby; now conſider this on the one part, the great God of heaven and earth, God the Father, God the Son, and God the holy Ghoſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake's to bee the God of his people, which is their happineſs: on the other part, the confederates, the parties baptized and ſealed as Gods own by Baptiſm (which <hi>Auſtin</hi> call's <hi>Regius Character,</hi> a Kingly Character,) do ſolemnly profeſs and oblige themſelves to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:114590:9"/> the faith and ſervice not of any Angel, for where is there ſuch a condition expreſſed in the Covenant to tie us to creatures? but as I ſaid, to the Faith, Service, and Obedience of God the Father, God the Son, and God the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>That which you ſay is true in it ſelf, though not in your mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that God the Father, and the Son, by the Spirit, do guid, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, ſanctifie, and endow the Church; and whereas before conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and the giving up their names to Chriſt, they lived according to the Prince of this world, they ought thenceforth, beeing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Church, reſign up themſelves to the guidance of the holy Ghoſt. But your ſaying that the holy Ghoſt is our Advocate in your ſenſe, and a chief inſtrument under God, is as a dead ſlie in precious ointment; this is ſpoken, but cannot bee proved by you; and it hath been before, and ſhall hereafter bee diſproved; yea, and your own conceſſion touching the benefits received from the holy Ghoſt ſtand's not with this aſſertion.</p>

                  </label> I grant the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt is not therefore <hi>ſimply</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable, becauſe it is ſimply againſt God; for ſo are all ſins, and yet are they not the unpardonable ſin, and they are in a proper and true ſenſe againſt the holy Ghoſt, even the ſins of his own people, and hee is ſaid to bee grieved for them, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 30. and the ſins of the wicked, for which hee will bee revenged on them, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 63. 10. But yet this I do peremptorily avouch, unleſs the holy Ghoſt were God, and equal to the Father, and the Son of God, it could not bee the greateſt ſin that was committed againſt him, as the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and ultimate object thereof. I will on your own principles argue againſt you for the fuller confirmation of this point.</p>
               <p>I take this for a granted Maxim, that the unpardonable ſin, is a ſin, and of neceſſitie muſt bee a ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt. This Aſſertion cannot with reaſon be denied. Upon this ſuppoſition of yours, that the holy Ghoſt is a creature, I argue thus, That the unpardonable ſin may bee committed, and yet the holy Ghoſt not
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:114590:12"/> at all ſinned againſt: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe the firſt and univerſal cauſe can immediatly of himſelf, without the intervening of any creature, ſo far enlighten a reprobate, that this ſin maliciouſly committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this light, ſhall bee for nature the very ſame, every way as hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, and as unpardonable, and yet not all againſt the holy Ghoſt. It is true, inſtruments are God's hands, and as they can do nothing without God, ſo God ordinarily will not work without them; but is Gods hand ſhortened? Can you give any reaſon why hee cannot do the ſame work without the creatures, which is inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally produced by them? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> ſuppoſe the Lord will not work thus immediatly by himſelf, cannot hee imploy an Angel, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to the holy Ghoſt, about this work of illumination? Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hee ſo far elevate this bleſſed creature above it ſelf touching the former ſtate, and actuate his abilities, that hee ſhall, as a means un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God, ſo far enlighten man, as is don at other times by the holy Ghoſt? And the bleſſed Spirit in the mean time according to your profane opinion, reſide in one place, and not intermeddle at all ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to command, or have any influence on this Angel in this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment? or if there ſhould bee a deficiencie ſtill in this creature, (which is very unreaſonable to imagine) cannot the great God ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the defect thereof? In this caſe wee have the unpardonable ſin committed, and yet not at all committed againſt the holy Ghoſt. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I confute you from this Scripture, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. on which our Argument is grounded. The holy Ghoſt (ſay you) is God's Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and hee is ſent as God's ſervant to enlighten men; at the ſame time this great God ſend's his Son alſo as his Meſſenger, for ſo hee is often called, but the holy Ghoſt is never called his Son: this Son of God, as you grant, is next unto God himſelf, higher and greater then the holy Ghoſt; and beſides, which is another ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to ſtrengthen the Argument, the holy Ghoſt is inviſible, the Son of God preſent's himſelf viſible to them, and his Perſon is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and purpoſely ſcorned and abuſed by them: and 'tis not eaſie to bee proved that they had the like miſchievous intentions, and malicious purpoſes againſt the Perſon of the holy Ghoſt. Judg now impartially whether is the greater ſin, and which in likelihood is the ſin moſt unpardonable? Whether the Lord will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bee more of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended for a ſin againſt the ſervant, againſt a Perſon inferior to the Son, then for a ſin againſt the greater, and againſt his wel-belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:114590:13"/> Son? And if a man bee not bereft of common ſenſe, hee muſt need's conclude againſt this Diſputant; and therefore, ſince the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt is unpardonable, but the ſin againſt the Son of God is not unpardonable, as the text ſheweth, it muſt of neceſſitie bee yielded, that the holy Ghoſt is God, and ſuperior to Chriſt, as hee is man, as hee is Mediator. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> if the holy Ghoſt were not God, the ſin committed againſt him could not bee the greateſt ſin. Can a ſin immediatly committed againſt a creature, bee greater then that which is directly againſt the Creätor? Doth not the greatneſs of the Perſon againſt whom the ſin is committed, aggravate the offence, and make the ſin to be ſo much the more hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, as the Perſon wronged by it is the greater? Is not a ſin againſt God, which is a breach of the firſt Table greater, (I mean of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual compariſon) then a ſin againſt the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Table, as this ſin whereof wee treat muſt bee, if it bee a ſin againſt the creature? I deny not, but they that ſin againſt a creature, do ſin againſt God, whoſe authoritie and law forbidding it are ſlighted; but ſhall therefore an immediate ſin againſt the workmanſhip of God, bee, as you contend, the more heinous, then that which is againſt the great God himſelf? I might tell you that you do onely ſay, that this ſin through the holy Ghoſt doth ſtrike at God himſelf as a ſuperior object thereof. You can never prove that this ſin is not terminated in the holy Ghoſt, but for Argument ſake grant it. At the Aſſiſes, as I remember, male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors are indicted for ſinning againſt our Soveraign Lord and his Laws, but is it as great a ſin as that which is immediatly againſt his Majeſtie? Suppoſe ſupreme Authority ſend's Ambaſſadors to a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain Prince, and they are diſgraced and killed, ('tis your own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, <hi>Argum</hi> 4) this redound's, I deny not, very much to the wrong of the ſupreme Authority, and 'tis don, and interpreted to bee don to them, not for their own, but for his ſake. Suppoſe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, a King ſhould ſend more honorable Ambaſſadors then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, as <hi>Balak</hi> did to <hi>Balaam,</hi> and joyn in commiſſion with them his chief favorites, was not the ſame ſin committed againſt theſe later ſervants greater then the former? But ſuppoſe a King himſelf ſhould go in his own Perſon about the ſame buſineſs, and they ſhould e-equally contemn him, was not the affront now and ſin committed of a deeper die? Give me leave (Chriſtian Reader) to endeavor to explicate, in as few words as may bee, how the ſin is ſaid to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:114590:13"/>
               <p> It is an undeniable truth, that all the actions of the divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, (thoſe onely excepted which are <hi>ad intra,</hi> of intrinſecal rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) are the joynt and undivided works of the three Perſons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is not a multiplied, but one divine eſſence, and the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of their working depend's on the unitie of the power, which is all one with the eſſence, <hi>Gregor.

Thus <hi>power</hi> is aſſcribed to the Father, becauſe hee is the principle of the Son, and of the holy Ghoſt; and therefore, becauſe the mightie power of God is manifeſted by Creätion, the Father is frequently ſtiled the Creätor. <hi>Wiſedom</hi> is aſſcribed to the Son of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee is termed <hi>conceptus Sapientiae:</hi> hence is it, that Redemption, wherein the manifold wiſedom of God is ſeen, is appropriated to the Son, hee is called Redeemer. <hi>Goodneſs</hi> is aſſcribed to the holy Ghoſt, becauſe hee proceed's from the Father, and the Son <hi>per mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum amoris:</hi> hence the good things of God which are communicated to us are appropriated to him, hee is called our Sanctifier. And for the ſame reaſon are ſins thus diſtinguiſhed; there is a <hi>ſin of Frailti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and that is ſaid to bee againſt the Father, who is Power; there is a <hi>ſin of Ignorance,</hi> and that is ſaid to bee againſt the Son, who is the Wiſedom of God; and there is a <hi>ſin of Wilfulneſs and Malice,</hi> and that is ſaid to bee againſt the holy Ghoſt, who is Goodneſs, <hi>Bonav. p.</hi> 1. <hi>Quaeſt.</hi> 39. <hi>Art.</hi> 8. This is a reaſon why this ſin is unpardonable, it's a ſin by appropriation both againſt his Perſon and his Gifts; 'tis not a ſin of weakneſs, nor a ſin of ignorance, no nor every groſs ſin againſt knowledg, no nor every apoſtaſie from the truth againſt the known truth; for ſom may fall away either out of fear of the loſs of their goods or lives, or for preferment; nor a few of this kinde have bewailed their follies, have obtained pardon, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved glorious Martyrs; but this is a ſin wittingly, and willingly, and out of cankred malice committed againſt God the Father, Son, and (a I ſaid) by appropriation, againſt God the holy Ghoſt, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:114590:14"/> his great work in their hearts, and whereby they offer contumelie and deſpite to the Spirit of Grace, and ſo will hee never give them the grace to repent.</p>

I add, <hi>this your Concluſion is ſuch a Paradox which hath ſearce dropped from the pen of any Chriſtian man.</hi> You think, belike, that the Spirit is like to Arch-angels, which are ſaid to preſide over Kingdoms, and great Perſonages onely; but the care of ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar mean perſons is, under God, committed to the Angels.

Belike then, they that have but one talent, or two talents, or mean men, which have but a low degree of ſanctifying graces, are not beholding to the Spirit for them, God never ſent his bleſſed Spirit to them; how falſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavory this expreſſion is, who ſeeth not? And the follie thereof ſhall bee fully diſproved in the next Reaſon.

Every one of theſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity require's the powerful work of a ſupreme Agent. A creature hath no more power to make a Saint of a ſinner, then hee hath to make of a vile lump of earth a glorious ſtar in heaven.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved; hee is called the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> becauſe holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is from him, <hi>per modum principii inhaerentis &amp; aſſiſtentis,</hi> 1 Pet. 12. called <hi>the Spirit of holineſs,</hi> Rom. 1. 4. and wee are ſaid to bee <hi>regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by the holy Ghoſt,</hi> Joh. 3. 5. <hi>renewed by the holy Ghost,</hi> Tit. 3. 5. to bee <hi>waſhed and ſanctified by the Spirit of our God,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 11. As there is but one ſoul in a man which quicken's all the members of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural bodie, ſo is there but onely one holy Ghoſt, which animate's all the myſtical members of Jeſus Chriſt; and as Chriſt our head was conceived by the holy Ghoſt, ſo the myſtical bodie is conceived by the Spirit of God. Every Chriſtian, as hee is a Chriſtian, hath his conception and new birth by the holy Ghoſt. I might ſhew this at large in the particular graces which are ſanctifying; a catalogue of many of them wee read <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22. and it is as true of the reſt, which are not there recited, they are all of them the fruit of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>The Arguments which I have already recited, will, I hope, and conceive, give ample ſatisfaction to the Chriſtian Reader: there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth another, grounded on the Word of God, to prove <hi>the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the holy Ghoſt;</hi> which I will ſet down, not onely becauſe many eminent Proteſtants, and men of note of the Church of Rome, do

For theſe or ſom other reaſons it is that the Son of God is called the Word; and hee bear's record to himſelf that hee is the Meſſiah, partly, <hi>by his works,</hi> Joh. 4. 26. partly, <hi>by his Doctrine,</hi> Joh. 5. 18.—Joh. 6. 29.—6. 37, 46. partly, <hi>by bis miracles,</hi> Joh. 10. 25. The holy Ghoſt bare record of him at his Baptiſm, when hee, in a viſible ſhape, aſſcended from heaven, and alighted on him. I argue from this text:</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> This is hinted from this text, becauſe the holy Ghoſt is joyned with God the Father in giving witneſs, which is all one, upon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that hee is a creature, as to add a drop to the Ocean. It is true, that the Spirit is joyned with the creatures ſomtimes in witneſs bearing. But <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.<hi>—ſpeaking by his Prophets—</hi>but thoſe very texts do ſtrengthen our faith touching the Deitie of the holy Ghoſt. For the further confirmation, let it bee conſidered, that all the creatures were made by J. Chriſt, and nothing was made without him. It is never ſpoken in the Scripture, that the holy Ghoſt was made by him. Coloſ. 1. 16. <hi>all things in heaven and in earth, viſible and inviſible, were creäted by him;</hi> and it is there added for illuſtration, that <hi>thrones, dominations, principalities and powers were creäted by him.</hi> The holy Ghoſt, had hee been a creature, and the chief of all the creatures, would not have been omitted, but by name expreſſed, <hi>the holy Ghoſt, principalities, powers,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Theſe <hi>three do bear witneſs in heaven;</hi> the meaning is not, as if the place where this record was given is in heaven, or to the heavenly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, but this is a record to men on earth; nor is it a teſtimonie which is given by the Angels: hence I draw a ſecond Argument, If by the holy Ghoſt was not meant a divine teſtimonie, or the teſtimonie of God himſelf, then there are not onely three which bear witneſs in heaven, as the text hold's forth, and muſt bee verified of three, but there are many more that witneſs Jeſus is the Meſſiah. Before his birth, to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Mat. 1. 20. After his birth, to the Shepherds, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 10. And a multitude of the heavenly hoſt praiſing God for this Meſſiah. <hi>Glorie bee to God on high,</hi> ver. 13. At his reſurrection, to thoſe

                  <hi>Theſe three</hi> (ſaith the text) <hi>are one:</hi> theſe words afford another Argument. To ſay nothing, that if they had not intended unitie in nature, but conſent in witneſs bearing, there was no neceſſitie of them; and the former words would have carried that ſenſe, <hi>There are three that bear witneſs, the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghoſt,</hi> that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is the Son of God. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> In this record they all agree; but becauſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions in Scripture are many times for explication or other purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, I add another ground, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The holy Ghoſt varying his language in this and the next verſe, ſaying in this verſe, that <hi>theſe are one;</hi> and not as in the next verſe, that <hi>they do agree in one:</hi> doth not this lead us, by perpending the different language, to a different interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the words?

                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> albeit our Engliſh phraſe is one in both, yet the exact Tranſlations in Latine are not the ſame in both places; they religiouſly do, in their Tranſlations, follow the Original, <hi>in unam carnem,</hi> or two ſhall bee <hi>in unâ carne.</hi>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:114590:20"/> fleſh, and ſo this later will bee a conſequent of the former. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> there is not the like reaſon betwixt theſe two texts; for I need not ſay, Ask the Scriptures, ask the Learned, but ask a very childe, and hee will tell you that man and wife are two diſtinct and ſeparated perſons, which may bee at a great diſtance, in regard of place, and likewiſe in regard of affection: and none are ſo ſimple to think, when man and wife are one fleſh, that they are one numerical and individual fleſh.

Not to repeat what I have formerly written, I ſay, this is boldly ſpoken, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted by our bleſſed Savior, <hi>John</hi> 10. 29. <hi>I and the Father</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>are one:</hi> how one? In the former verſes hee require's they ſhould beleeve in him, promiſeth that hee will give unto his children eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life; and ſuch is his divine power, that none can take them out of his hands; and uſeth the ſelf ſame words in the next verſe, <hi>none ſhall take them out of my Father's hands:</hi> and then ſaith, <hi>I and my Father are one;</hi> viz. <hi>in power,</hi> and conſequently, <hi>in eſſence;</hi> for the power of God, and the eſſence of God are all one thing. This my Adverſarie, which denie's this Aſſertion, ſwerv's not onely from the plain mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the text, but ſhew's that hee hath leſs underſtanding then our very enemies of Chriſt had; for they collected, and that rightly from thence, that Chriſt profeſſed himſelf thereby to bee God. </p>

It's not to be doubted, but they have offred the like violence to this place, as they did to a text in S. <hi>John,</hi> as is witneſſed by <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> God is a Spirit, which they unconſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably cancelled, and razed out of their own books; and I wiſh, did not blot it out of the books of the Church: this ſacriledg was plainly detected.

               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is evident; for if hee ſhould both bee God, and bee diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from God, hee would bee diſtinguiſhed from himſelf, which implieth a contradiction. The <hi>Minor</hi> is confirmed by the whole current of the Scripture, which calleth him <hi>the Spirit of God,</hi> and ſaith, that <hi>hee is ſent by God, and ſearcheth the depths of God, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Neither let any man here think to flie to that ignorant refuge of making a diſtinction between the <hi>Eſſence</hi> and <hi>Perſon</hi> of God, ſaying, that the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is distinguiſhed from God, taken Perſonally, not Eſſentially. For this wretched diſtinction (to omit the mention of the Primitive Fathers) is not onely unheard of in the Scripture, and ſo to bee rejected, it being preſumption to affirm any thing of the unſearchable nature of God, which hee hath not firſt affirmed of himſelf in the Scripture; but is alſo diſclaimed by Reaſon. For firſt, it is impoſſible for any man, if hee would but endeavor to conceive the thing, and not delude both himſelf and others with emptie terms and words without underſtanding, to diſtinguiſh the Perſon from the Eſſence of God, and not to frame two beeings or things in his minde, and conſequently two Gods. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> If the Perſon be diſtinct from the Eſſence of God, then it is either ſomthing or nothing: if nothing, how can it bee diſtinguiſhed, ſince nothing hath no accidents? If ſomthing, then either ſome finite or infinite thing; if finite, then there will be ſomthing finite in God: and conſequently, ſince by the confeſſion of the Adverſaries themſelvs, every thing in God is God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, God will bee finite, which the Adverſaries themſelves will likewiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to bee abſurd. If infinite, then there will bee two infinites in God, to wit, the Perſon and Eſſence of God; and conſequently two Gods, which is more abſurd then the former. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> to talk of God taken onely Eſſentially is ridiculous, not onely becauſe there is no example thereof in Scripture, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God is the name of a Perſon, and ſignifieth him that ruleth over others; and when it is put for the moſt high God, it denoteth him who with ſoveraign and abſolute, authoritie ruleth over all; but none but a perſon can rule over
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:114590:24"/> others, all actions being proper to perſons: wherefore to take God otherwiſe then Perſonally, is to take him otherwiſe then hee is, and indeed to miſtake him.</p>

                  <p>
                     <label>Major.</label> Hee <hi>that is diſtinguiſhed from God</hi> (ſay you) <hi>is not God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this Propoſition I anſwer, by clearing the meaning of it thus: Hee, that is, that perſon which is diſtinguiſhed, that is, really ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from, and ſubſtantially divided from God, is not God. In this ſenſe this <hi>Major</hi> is undoubtedly true.</p>
                  <p>Let no man look upon the Propoſition thus limited, as a forced evaſion to elude the Argument; for it hold's forth fully the minde of the Adverſarie: His opinion is, the holy Ghoſt and God do differ as much as a finite creature differ's from the infinite Creä<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Minor.</label> Your <hi>Minor</hi> run's thus, <hi>The holy Spirit is diſtinguiſhed from God;</hi> for hee is the Spirit of God. To this I anſwer both by denial and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>Firſt by denial,</hi> if the term, <hi>diſtinguiſhed,</hi> be taken in the aſſumption, as it is intended and explicated in the Propoſition; for the Spirit of God is not ſo diſtinguiſhed from God, as a creature is diſtinguiſhed from the Creätor.</p>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> I aſſent to the <hi>Minor,</hi> if it bee taken in an Orthodoxal ſenſe; for albeit the bleſſed Spirit is not ſo diſtinguiſhed, as to bee ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from God, yet is hee diſtinguiſhed from God taken perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, as of neceſſitie it muſt be taken in this place, as appear's by the proofs of the <hi>Minor:</hi> for the third perſon of the Trinitie is neither the firſt nor the ſecond perſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Further,</hi> let us take a diſtinct view of the Syllogiſm, and I avouch it is either a falſe Syllogiſm, or it prove's nothing.</p>

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> it is a falſe Syllogiſm, and conſiſt's of four terms, if the term <hi>[God]</hi> be taken in a different ſenſe, as eſſentially in the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and Concluſion, and perſonally in the Aſſumption, it is a fault parallel to this reaſoning.</p>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> I anſwer, if the term <hi>[God]</hi> be taken, as it ought to bee, in all the axioms in one ſenſe, then the Syllogiſm conclude's nothing for the Adverſarie; for this muſt bee the meaning of it:</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>This Syllogiſm thus explicated, is readily aſſented to by the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous conſent of the Churches.</p>
                  <p>There is a fallacious homonymie of the word <hi>[God,]</hi> which hee make's frequent uſe of to abuſe his Reader; which (like corrupt blood) run's thorow the veins of all his Arguments. If hee know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the meaning of it, his ignorance is to bee pitied; if hee know's it, and yet preſume's to ſeduce the unwarie, his impietie is to bee deteſted. Hee well fore-ſaw the uſual diſtinction of <hi>God taken</hi> ſomtimes <hi>eſſentially,</hi> and ſomtimes <hi>perſonally</hi> in the word of God, would cut the ſinews and ſtrength of his reaſons; and therfore this, as a great block, muſt bee removed out of the way. This hee cal's an <hi>ignorant refuge,</hi> and <hi>a wretched diſtinction.</hi> Behold, brethren, the modeſtie of the man, whereby hee diſcover's the bitterneſs and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancie of his ſpirit; a weak and wilful man, who never took de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in Divinitie, nor ever was a Profeſſor of that higheſt and beſt learning, magiſterially condemneth millions of profeſſed eminent Divines in this and former ages, for flying to an ignorant refuge, and for denying the truth by the help of a wretched diſtinction.</p>
                  <p>But what, I pray, is this ignorant diſtinction? It is for making a diſtinction betwixt the Eſſence and Perſon of God.</p>
                  <p>I intreat the Reader to take notice of the palpable darkneſs which hee diſcover's, even in the ſame place where hee accuſeth his betters of ignorance, of making a diſtinction betwixt the Eſſence and the Perſon of God: But, my friend, was it your task to prove this? Do
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:114590:25" rendition="simple:additions"/> but review the parts of your Syllogiſm, and you ſhall finde that they drive on this deſign, that a perſon is diſtinguiſhed from a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that the Spirit of God, which is a Perſon, and ſent of God, muſt needs be a perſon diſtinct from God that ſent him. If you will ſay, you ſpeak in the Perſon of your Adverſaries, I denie, that any learned man ever expreſſed himſelf in that manner; if you can name any, let him bear his own blame. The diſtinction of God taken eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially and perſonally, differ's much from that which is betwixt the eſſence and perſon of God, as in due place I will prove. Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe my intention aime's at the benefits of the Readers, I will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low you in theſe your erring ſteps, to treat of the <hi>difference betwixt the Eſſence of God, and the Perſon of God.</hi> There is a reall diſtinction, and there is a diſtinction in regard of our rational conception. The former is denied, the later is aſſerted touching the nature of God, and the Perſon of the holy Ghoſt; for albeit in creäted things, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is one thing, and a perſon is another thing: (for a man is not the humane nature: <hi>Thomas</hi> is not the nature of <hi>Thomas;)</hi> yet in God, by reaſon of the abſolute ſimplicitie of his nature, the divine nature and the Perſon are the ſame thing, <hi>Thom.</hi> 1. <hi>Sum. q.</hi> 3. <hi>art.</hi> 3. yet is there a diſtinction of reaſon, as they ſpeak; for there is one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the nature, and another of the perſon: for the nature, as it is the divine nature, is communicated to the perſon, and ſubſiſt's in it; but the perſon is the very <hi>ſuppoſitum,</hi> in which the nature ſubſiſt's, and which in this particular conſideration is incommunicable, as the definition of a perſon evinceth, in which regard it is, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth the diſtinction of the Perſons multiply the natures in God, nor doth the unitie of the nature confound the Perſons.</p>
                  <p>I return now to the diſtinction: God is taken either eſſentially, or perſonally, which I ſhall juſtifie againſt his clamors and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; for, if you demand, Hath hee no reaſons to write tartly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it? No ſound ones, I am ſure; but ſuch as they are, I will now examine.</p>

Thus, the Father is alone Jehovah, the Son is alone Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:114590:29"/> and God the holy Ghoſt is alone Jehovah: and the reaſon is plain, and unanſwerable; becauſe, albeit the Father is Lord, the Son is Lord, and the holy Ghoſt is Lord; yet are there not three Lords, but one Lord, ſaith the Athanaſian Creed. <hi>I am the Lord, and there is none elſe, there is no God beſides mee: and it ſhall bee known from Eaſt to Weſt, that there is none beſides mee, and there is none elſe,</hi> Iſa. 45. 5, 6.</p>

The <hi>Major</hi> is proved thus: God ſpeaketh of himſelf; therefore if there bee any one that ſpeaketh not of himſelf, hee is not God.

The conſequence is undeniable. For further confirmation of this Argument, it is to bee obſerved, that to ſpeak or to do any thing not if himſelf, according to the ordinarie phraſe of Scripture, is to ſpeak or do by the ſhewing, teaching, commanding, authoriſing, or enabling of another, and conſequently incompatible with the ſupreme and ſelf-ſufficient Majeſtie of God. <hi>Vid.

                  <p>Mark then, albeit the work bee the ſame, and 'tis from all the Perſons, yet is there a difference in the manner of working: the Father, and the Son, as they are the Fountain of the Perſon of the holy Ghoſt, ſo likewiſe are they the Fountain of the operations of the holy Ghoſt.

Nor ſhould they think that the holy Ghoſt ſhould bring any new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but the truths taught by him, are the truths of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; there is a plenary conſent of the Doctrine of the holy Ghoſt, and of God the Father; that which the holy Ghoſt ſpeak's from the Father, hee had not in time, but by eternal proceſſion from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son of God. There is no diverſitie at all in the work, in it ſelf conſidered, but the order of externally working anſwer's to the order of the divine Perſons: thus is the holy Ghoſt ſaid not to work from himſelf, but from the Father and Son.

If it had been onely ſaid, <hi>hee ſhall bee,</hi> it might bee thought hee is not now. Time paſt, preſent, and to come are aſſcribed to God; yet not as to men, to denote a beginning, continuance, and end of time: for, actions are ſaid to have been, which now are not, and that they ſhall bee, which now have no exiſtence at all: but when they are ſpoken of God, there is no limitation of time at all. God ſo hath been, that hee is, and ſhall bee: hee ſhall bee, yet ſo, that hee is and hath been, and this is to bee applied likewiſe to the hearing of the holy Ghoſt. Hee hath alwaies heard, and hee doth hear. And in the future time it's ſaid in this place, hee ſhall hear. This hearing, ſaith S. <hi>Auſtin, Tractat.</hi> 99. <hi>in Joan.</hi> is everlaſting. Hee hath known, hee doth know, and hee will know.

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:114590:32"/> to us, thoſe things, and no other will hee reveal to us; the truths which the Spirit ſhall reveal to us, are truths received from God the Father; the Spirit feign's nothing, hee alter's nothing, hee pervert's nothing.

                     </label> The <hi>Major,</hi> if it bee general, as it ought to bee, thus; <hi>Whoſoever receiveth of another is not God,</hi> is falſe.

And will you from hence infer that hee is not God?</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>Major</hi> bee particular in ſenſe thus; Somthing that receive's from another is not God.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, I anſwer firſt in general, that theſe three Arguments, viz. <hi>to hear from another, to ſpeak what hee heare's,</hi> and <hi>to receive of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,</hi> are multiplied words, not Arguments; they are like three dreams varied in forms, yet for ſubſtance they are but one. Yet I will ſay ſomthing in particular.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> One thing or perſon may bee ſaid to receive of another two man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of waies: <hi>Firſt,</hi> by eternal proceſſion to apply it to the holy Ghoſt; and by eternal generation, as doth the Son of God, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive's the Eſſence, and, as they are called, the eſſential properties from his Father, who doth beget him, as from an intrinſecal prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, to him who is generated. Thus is it in natural generation, children receive from their parents their beeing and natural quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: i'ts evident, hee that receive's his ſoul by infuſion, receiveth at the ſame inſtant the eſſential faculties of the ſoul: and ſo wee may ſay the holy Ghoſt, as the holy Ghoſt, whatſoever hee is, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hee hath, hee hath received from the Father and the Son of God, not as from an external but intrinſecal principle; and it may bee ſaid of the holy Ghoſt, as it is of the Son of God, that <hi>hee hath life in himſelf given by the Father,</hi> Joh. 5. 26. How did the Father and Son give life? by active ſpiration. How did the holy Ghoſt receive it? by eternal proceſſion. And, what is it to have life in himſelf, but to have it eſſentially, and to bee life it ſelf? The holy Ghoſt, as hee is God ſimply conſidered, as hee is the ſame Eſſence with the Father who is God, is (I grant) of himſelf, and hath from
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:114590:34"/> his Eſſence whatſoever hee hath; but, as this is communicated by eternal proceſſion, ſo hee hath it from the firſt and ſecond Perſon of the Trinitie. Wee may ſee a reſemblance of this Myſterie in the creatures: thus <hi>Peter,</hi> as hee is a man, 'tis from his humane nature, and ſo whatſoever in this conſideration hee hath is natural to him; but <hi>Peter,</hi> as hee is a Son, receive's all from his Parents by natural generation: and thus, albeit the holy Ghoſt receive's from another, <hi>viz.</hi> from God the Father, and God the Son, yet is hee properly and truly God.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> This is the firſt way of receiving from another. <hi>Secondly,</hi> a thing may bee ſaid, and it's uſual, to receive in time, and from an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal principle, as men do their beeing, habits of knowledg, &amp;c. to bee <hi>in potentia</hi> to receive, and therefore is imperfect, and in ſom wants: Such a receiving as this is (I grant) belonge's not to God.</p>

                     </label> I anſwer, if you will ſoundly prove this <hi>Minor,</hi> you muſt produce ſom other Scripture; for this holy text will not ſerve your turn: it doth not ſay, as you pretend, the Spirit receiveth of mee, which was to bee proved; and yet, if it had ſo expreſly ſaid, it would not have ſupported your impious cauſe, as I now have ſhewed; the text onely ſaith, <hi>hee receiveth of mine,</hi> viz. what is teſtified of mee by the Prophets; and that is don, when, by the powerful preaching of the Goſpel, hee give's a clear teſtimonie that Chriſt is the Son of God, and Savior of the world, and chiefly hee receive's of mine, to ſpeak after the manner of men, when hee bring's it home to the hearts of the elect by effectually calling and converting them, by raiſing up their mindes to know the divine truths, and their hearts by faith to embrace them, by rectifying their diſordered affections, by enabling them to confeſs, publiſh, and magnifie the Lord Jeſus with their tongues, and to conform their lives to thoſe heavenly directions which Chriſt hath left us on record. Thus doth the holy Ghoſt glorifie Chriſt, in that whatſoever the holy Ghoſt work's in our hearts, whether it bee touching doctrine, remiſſion of ſins, or ſanctification, hee receive's all from Chriſt, and ſo diſpenſeth them to us. The Spirit waſheth us from our ſins, but by the blood of Chriſt: hee hee mortifie's ſins in us, but it is by virtue of the death of Chriſt:
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:114590:34"/> hee raiſeth us up to newneſs of life, but by virtue of the reſurrection of Chriſt, &amp;c. In this conſiſt's the glorie of Chriſt. And were you not blinded by Satan, you would bee ſo far from perverting this Scripture to the diſhonor of the holy Ghoſt, that you would rather infer from thence both the Trinitie of the Perſons, and the Deitie of the holy Ghoſt. All that the Father hath (ſaith Chriſt) are truly mine, and what are mine, the holy Ghoſt receive's, not as a ſcholar, from the directions of his Maſter, as though thereby hee learned any new thing formerly unknown: But, as the Son of God doth not ſpeak from himſelf, but what hee hear's from the Father, no more doth the holy Ghoſt, but what hee receive's from the Son; all three Perſons working the ſame work in our redemption.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is plain from the fore-quoted place <hi>John</hi> 16. 7. The <hi>Major</hi> is evinced thus: Hee that miniſtreth is not God; hee that is ſent ministreth: <hi>Ergò.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> is undubitable, it being diſſonant to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Majeſtie of God to miniſter and ſerve another; for that were to bee God, and not God; to exerciſe ſoveraign dominion over all, and not to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe it. The <hi>Minor</hi> is confirmed by <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. <hi>ult.</hi> where the divine Author ſheweth, that the Angels are all miniſtring ſpirits, in that they are ſent forth; as hee before intimated Chriſt to bee Lord, becauſe hee ſitteth at the right hand of God. Thus <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 2. declareth the Soveraigntie of God, in ſaying, that hee ſitteth in heaven. The <hi>Minor</hi> is further proved thus: Hee that receiveth a command for the performance of ſomthing, doth miniſter; Hee that is ſent forth, receiveth a command for the performance of ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: <hi>Ergò.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> is evident to common ſenſe, ſince it ſuiteth with none but miniſters and inferiors to receive commands. The <hi>Minor</hi> is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by <hi>John</hi> 12. 49. <hi>The Father that hath ſent mee, hee gave mee a command what I ſhall ſpeak.</hi> Neither let any man here reply, that this very thing is ſpoken alſo of Chriſt, unleſs, having firſt proved that Chriſt is ſupreme God, hee will grant that whatſoever is ſpoken of him, is ſpoken of him as God: or can make good that to bee ſent at leaſt may agree to him as God. The contrarie whereof I ſuppoſe I have clearly proved in this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhewing that it is unſutable to the divine Majeſtie.</p>

                     </label> It will not bee amiſs, to premiſe ſom conſiderations touching <hi>ſending,</hi> on which word the ſtrength of the Argument depend's, that ſo the point may bee more fully cleared, and the Adverſaries reaſon more diſtinctly anſwered.</p>
                  <p>A Perſon is ſaid to be ſent either properly or improperly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To bee ſent</hi> properly, according to our vulgar acception of the word, requireth theſe particulars.</p>

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> that the Perſon ſent bee really divided from, and actually
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:114590:36"/> ſeparated from him that ſend's him, this is evidently ſeen by daily experience.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> it's required of him that is ſent, that hee move's from an <hi>ubi,</hi> or from place to place, which is a neceſſarie condition, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedite the emploiment about which hee is ſent.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it denote's, that the Perſon ſent is inferior to the ſender, either in nature or condition, or both: as, when the Lord ſend's Men or Angels about his ſervice; in this ſenſe Princes ſend their ſubjects, Parents their children, Maſters their ſervants.—And thus bodies repreſentative, whether civill or eccleſiaſtical, may ſend ſom of their members about publick affairs of Church or State, becauſe the whole is greater then the parts thereof. And when an equal or ſuperior act's for an equal or inferior in points of wrong and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, charitie and mercie, this is not don (unleſs upon a compact and mutual conſent) by ſending them, but by a voluntarie conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion, or by the prevalent perſuaſion of equals or inferiors.</p>
                  <p>But now, when wee ſpeak of <hi>divine ſending,</hi> in reference to the Perſons of the bleſſed Trinitie, wee muſt abandon all baſe and low conceptions, and raiſe up our ſpirits by the light of other Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, to an apprehenſion of the excellencie of the nature thereof.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> it denote's not a diviſion or ſeparation of the divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; for this would neceſſarily imply the multiplication of the <note place="margin">1. <hi>Negative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> it denote's not a moving from place to place, a change of place; for the third Perſon, in regard of the eſſence, is every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and there is no place any where whither hee can com, where hee was not alwaies preſent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> nor doth it denote any inferioritie or inequalitie of the divine Perſon, but in reſpect of the divine Perſon ſending, they are one in nature, and co-equal, and co-eternal, touching their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>poſitively,</hi> this miſſion argue's a diſtinction of the divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. <note place="margin">2. <hi>Poſitively.</hi>
                     </note> The Father, in Scripture phraſe, is no where ſaid to bee ſent, but hee ſend's the Son and the holy Ghoſt; becauſe hee is firſt in order. The firſt Perſon of the Trinitie, hee is of himſelf, and from
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:114590:36"/> himſelf, and the fountain of communicating the God-head to his Son, and both the Father and the Son to the holy Ghoſt. And, as it denote's a diſtinction of Perſons, ſo is it properly an external per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal operation; for although miſſion, <hi>quantum ad principale ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum,</hi> is external; yet, <hi>ratione connotati,</hi> it's onely in time. <hi>Halenſis.</hi> And ſo the whole is called temporal; as, when a neceſſarie thing is joyned with a contingent, the whole is judged contingent; ſo ſaith our Countriman plainly thus: <hi>This miſſion is nothing elſe, but a new manner of the manifeſtation of the preſence of the holy Ghoſt by ſom effect.</hi> And this is don either viſibly, by ſom viſible Symbol and external repreſentation of his preſence; as, by deſcending from heaven on Chriſt in the likeneſs of a Dove, or in fierie cloven tongues on the Apoſtles: And this was extraordinarie; or ordinarily God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Son is ſaid to ſend him into the hearts of his children, by working ſaving graces in them, when hee manifeſt's his preſence by ſpiritual operations. It's not in the power of man thus to ſend him; for all that hee can do is onely external, diſpoſing by adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sacraments, obtaining by Prayer, inſtructing and moving outwardly by preaching.—The holy Ghoſt is ſent in the uſe of theſe Ordinances, yet not by them, but by reaſon of internal grace, which God alone creätes in the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Theſe concluſions being laid down, it will bee an eaſie task to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie the ſuppoſed knots of this Argument.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is plain by <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 17. <hi>Foraſmuch then as God gave them the like gift</hi> (meaning the Spirit) <hi>as hee did unto us, who have beleeved on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, was I one that could with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand God?</hi> The <hi>Major,</hi> though of it ſelf ſufficiently clear, is further evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced thus; Hee that is not the giver of all things, is not God; hee that is the gift of God, is not the giver of all things: <hi>Ergò.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 25. <hi>God giveth to all, life, breath, and all things.</hi> The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved thus; Hee that is himſelf given, is not the giver of all things; hee that is the gift of God, is himſelf given: <hi>Ergò.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> is undeniable; for otherwiſe the ſame would bee the giver of all things, and yet not the giver of all things, inaſmuch as hee himſelf, a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal thing, is given, which implieth a contradiction. The <hi>Minor</hi> needeth no proof. Moreover, a gift is in the power, and at the diſpoſal of the giver; but it is groſs and abſurd to imagine that God can bee in the power, or at the diſpoſal of another. Neither let any man here think to evade by ſaying, That not the holy Spirit himſelf, but onely his gifts are imparted to men; ſince both the more learned Adverſaries themſelves confeſs, that the Perſon of the holy Spirit is given together with his gifts; and the Scripture putteth the matter out of doubt, if you conſult <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9. 20. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 5.

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:114590:38"/> from him; in the <hi>other,</hi> contra-diſtinctly from the love of God diffuſed in our hearts by him. Whence wee may draw this Corollarie, that if the Perſon of the holy Spirit bee out of favor given to certain men, as the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid places teſtifie, then hee was not perſonally preſent with them before, and conſequently by the conceſſion of the Adverſaries, themſelves, cannot bee God, ſince they will not deny that God is alwaies perſonally preſent with all alike.

                     </label> The Propoſition, if it bee generally extended to every gift of God; (as, if you will logically diſpute, it ought to bee: for if one were able to make an induction of every ſingular gift of God, and if there were one particular excepted) it would bee virtually falſe. Hee that is the gift of God, <hi>viz.</hi> of God the Father, or God the Son, is God; for, it is not unuſual in the Scripture, I muſt often put you in mind hereof, for the name <hi>[God]</hi> to bee taken for the firſt Perſon of the Trinitie, the ſecond Perſon is called the Son of God, the third Perſon is called the Spirit of God: and the firſt Perſon is often ſo called, not becauſe hee is a higher God then God the Son, or God the holy Ghoſt, for they are equal; but firſt, becauſe hee is the firſt in order: and ſecondly, becauſe hee is the Perſon, by whom the God-head is communicated to the Son, &amp;c. Hence it is, becauſe the Father hath original from no other, and is the principle of the Deitie, hee is ſimply called God; not the God of another God: for, if the Father had begot the divine eſſence, hee might bee called not onely God, but the Father of God; but, becauſe hee doth not
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:114590:38"/> beget that eſſence, which is communicated to the Son of God, but the Son: therefore hee is not called the Father of God, but the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his Son. And in proportion the like is to bee ſpoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God the holy Ghoſt, and the ſame order is to bee obſerved of the works wrought in time. God the Father by the Son, and thorough the holy Ghoſt beſtoweth ordinarie, extraordinarie gifts, as it pleaſeth him; and theſe three Perſons are co-eternal, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſential.</p>
                  <p>If your Propoſition bee virtually particular, it prove's nothing. Som gift of God is not God. It's true in this ſenſe, no creäted gift of God, is God himſelf; but the holy Ghoſt is no ſuch gift: hee is a gift indeed, but an uncreäted gift, not leſſer, but equal to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Son that give's him. And though I yield the holy Ghoſt is a gift, yet your proof, <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 17. is not convincing; for to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that ſom render, <hi>the ſame grace,</hi> by gift may very well bee underſtood the miraculous gifts of the holy Spirit, which then <note place="margin">

This is true; but is this any thing for your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe? Nothing at all. Nay, it make's ſtrongly againſt you; for the holy Ghoſt is the Creätor, Preſerver and Giver of all things: hee give's life, and breath, and all things to the creatures.

And albeit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Divines do varie in their expreſſions, yet all agree in the main point againſt you, that the holy Ghoſt was with all them to whom hee is given before hee was a gift to them, as touching his natural and powerful preſence; and thus hee is alſo with the very devils, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, the elect uncalled, and all other creatures which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of this gift of holineſs and of happineſs. Yet the holy Ghoſt, when hee is given, hee is with the Saints in a new way, in ſuch a manner as hee was not preſent before: in this regard it is, that the Saints are called the Temples of the holy Ghoſt, and a Temple is Gods peculiar, hee dwell's in the Saints, and is graciouſly preſent with them, they have him preſent by faith, and other graces, when hee is known and beloved of man. And this is not onely underſtood of the gifts of God, but of God himſelf, whom wee know by faith, and love by charitie. Nor is it any marvel, that God ſhould bee preſent without any change on his part; for the bodily Sun, as wee know, without any mutation in the Sun at all, is preſent to him that will open his eies to look upon it.

                     </label> I except not againſt your <hi>Major,</hi> nor againſt the explication and confirmation of it; that God is every-where, is religiouſly and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly acknowledged, becauſe the eſſence of God is moſt ſimple and infinite abſolutely, and ſo is the vertue of working infinite alſo: and, if it was not every-where, it would be limited. It's a memorable expreſſion uſed by <hi>Hermes Triſmegiſtus,</hi> a Heathen, hee compare's <hi>God</hi> to <hi>a perfect Sphere, whoſe centre is every-where, and circumference no where.</hi> As the ſoul is in the bodie, wholly in the whole bodie, and wholly in every part of the bodie, albeit it's ſaid to bee chiefly in the heart or brain, becauſe in and by thoſe parts it perform's the moſt excellent operations; ſo is our great God wholly in heaven, wholly on the earth, wholly every-where in a divine and ſpiritual manner, not <hi>included</hi> in any place, nor <hi>excluded</hi> out of it, although hee is frequently ſaid to bee in heaven, becauſe there moſt conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly hee manifeſt's his glorie and his goodneſs to the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and bleſſed Saints.</p>
                  <p>I denie your <hi>Minor;</hi> for although the holy Ghoſt is ſaid to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from heaven, yet was hee in heaven then, and every-where elſe. And there are divers circumſtances in the text to convince what you from thence would denie, that hee is God who deſcended, and that the holy Ghoſt was not perſonally contained within the compaſs of a Dove, real or in repreſentation, becauſe hee did not aſſume into the unitie of his Perſon this Dove; and if hee had don ſo, yet would not hee have been <hi>definitively</hi> or <hi>circumſcriptively</hi> therein: nor can hee bee ſaid to deſcend on Chriſt in regard of ſanctification, becauſe
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:114590:41"/> Chriſt even from the inſtant of his incarnation was full of grace. Nor was there any addition of holineſs to Chriſt by the deſcent of a Dove upon him, but hee repreſented himſelf in the ſhape of a Dove as in his ſign; and 'tis not obſcurely made out by the text, that hee is God: for what was the ſcope of the Evangeliſt? why doth hee relate this ſtorie? was it not to manifeſt that Jeſus Chriſt, both by the voice of his Father, and this deſcent of a Dove, was publickly authoriſed to exerciſe his prophetical, ſacerdotal and regal offices, to redeem the elect, and to reconcile them to God? The circumſtance of the time may leade us to ſuch a conſideration; hee is firſt inau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurated to this office, and then hee begin's to put it in execution: and ſo wee ſee that the Father by his voice, and the holy Ghoſt by his viſible deſcent upon him, did call him to this great work. None can ſend any Prophet but God alone, much leſs is it in the power of any creature to ſend Jeſus Chriſt to redeem the world, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 15. See <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 18. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 61. 1. Moreover it is never ſpoken of any Angel or pure creature, that the heaven was rent, and opened, as it is ſaid hereof, <hi>Mar.</hi> 1. 10. this was a ſymbol of the ſingular preſence of God, whereby wee may learn that this Spirit was God's Spirit, yea God himſelf. Add that it is ſomthing that this Spirit whereof you do ſpeak, deſcended on Jeſus, and remained on him, <hi>John</hi> 1. 33. but where do wee reade that creäted ſpirits deſcended on, and abode on him? It is their office, wee know, to miniſter as ſervants unto him, and to worſhip him, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1. 6. Laſtly, the ſame Spirit that deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Jeſus, did alſo lead him into the wilderneſs to bee tempted of the Divel, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 1. Is it in the power of any creature to lead Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt up and down, eſpecially into ſolitarie deſerts, and to this end to bee tempted by the Divel? Well, if this circumſtance fail, yet by other circumſtances in the text it's clear enough, that S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> with good reaſon did ſay, <hi>Go thou Arian to Jordane, and there thou ſhalt ſee the Trinitie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I add, if there bee any ſenſe of the Deitie in you, conſider I pray, of your (ſhall I call it) <hi>extreme blindneſs,</hi> or rather <hi>abominable impietie,</hi> which you diſcover by this your Argument. Why ſo? the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith, that <hi>hee could not go any where from the preſence of God's Spirit, Pſal.</hi> 139. But if you ſay true, ſuppoſe wee, that you could have taken the wings of the morning, and remove, as the light of the Sun doth (as it were) transfuſe it ſelf from Eaſt to Weſt in the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:114590:41"/> turning of a hand, the Spirit of the Lord would bee no where with you in theſe inferior parts of the world; and if you could have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended into heaven, &amp; have had a glorified ſoul, &amp; have been able to view all thoſe heavenly manſions, when the holy Ghoſt deſcended down from heaven, you could not (if you ſay true) have found him there. Beſides, by this your reaſoning, there could not then have been one Saint on earth, in whom the holy Spirit did dwell, who was enlightned, purified, comforted, ſtrengthned and guided by the holy Ghoſt; for, if notwithſtanding the deſcending of the holy Ghoſt in this likeneſs, this admirable action was no hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance why the holy Ghoſt ſhould not bee in every Saint, what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can bee alledged, why, albeit hee thus deſcended from heaven, hee ſhould not bee ſtill eſſentially in heaven? Surely the divinitie which you would teach us is odious divinitie, and if you literally preſs the very words againſt the ubiquitie of the holy Ghoſt, might not an Atheiſt as ſtrongly argue, and with as good reaſon as you do, that God is not on earth, hee is confined within the circles of the heaven, Why? becauſe the Father ſpoke from heaven, This is my welbeloved Son. But what ſhift can you make to elude the words of the Pſalmiſt, and bee true and conſtant to your own Argument? God <hi>bowed the heavens, and came down,</hi> Pſal. 18. 9. Here is in your own language <hi>terminus à quo,</hi> hee came from heaven; and <hi>terminus ad quem,</hi> hee came to the preſervation of his children, and the deſtruction of his enemies. And, if I ſinfully would dally with Scripture, I might preſs you ſore with the next verſe, <hi>Hee rode upon a Cherub, and did flie, yea hee did flie upon the wings of the winde.</hi> And doth the ſupreme Majeſtie remove from place to place? Yea, and the Lord himſelf ſaid, <hi>Bring the Officers to the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and I will com down, and talk with them there,</hi> Numb. 11. 16, 17. What ſhould I ſpeak of that gracious promiſe of Chriſt, <hi>If any man keep my words, I and the Father will com unto him, and abide with him,</hi> John 14. 23. What mean's the Lord's leaving of his children for a time, and that threatning, <hi>I will go to my place,</hi> Hoſ. 5. 15. Theſe and many like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions to theſe in Gods word might bee as ſtrong to conclude as yours, that the ſupreme Majeſtie changeth place, which is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendently abſurd.</p>
                  <p>Nor do wee want in Scripture viſible demonſtrations of the like preſence of God to this of the Dove. Was not the pillar of fire to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:114590:42"/> conduct the Iſraëlites in the wilderneſs, which moved ocularly from place to place viſible ſign of the Lords preſence? what elſe was the meaning of the Lord's threatning in his wrath that hee would give over the people to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and to the conduct of an Angel contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinct from God himſelf, that hee would withdraw the ſign of his preſence from them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 34. as after hee did, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. And what now doth the great God go from place to place? And was it not the Lord that paſſed by, and was not in the great winde, nor in the earth-quake, nor in the fire, but in the <hi>ſoft voice</hi> that ſpoke to <hi>Elias</hi> the Prophet, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 19. 15. Much more in this kinde might bee alledged, but this is enough to ſhew the weakneſs and impietie of this Adverſarie, who denieth the Deitie of the holy Ghoſt by no better argument then what would prove the ſupreme Majeſtie, by himſelf ſo acknowledged, to bee no true God at all.</p>

                     <hi>The firſt Concluſion,</hi> wee are to conſider of God <hi>abſolutely,</hi> as hee is plainly revealed in the Word, and accordingly acknowledged by all thoſe which are in outward covenant with him, that hee is true God, the ever-living God, the onely wiſe and powerful God, &amp;c. Thus in the Chaldean language in <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. 10, 11. both for a cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and inſtruction to the Jews, when they ſhould bee captives there, 'tis ſaid, <hi>The gods that made not the heavens and the earth, they ſhall periſh.</hi> Or elſe wee may conceive of God <hi>relatively,</hi> as diſtinctly to bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended to bee God the Father, God the Son, God the holy Ghoſt.

And yet I grant that God never heard any but for his
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:114590:47"/> Sons ſake, nor could ever any man make an acceptable praier to God, but by the help and direction of the holy Ghoſt. The former was clearly revealed in the Old Teſtament, <hi>The Lord thy God is one Lord,</hi> Deut. 6. 4. and in many other places not needful to bee reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but the myſterie of the Trinitie was not clearly revealed, but myſtically expreſſed, and in great wiſdom wee are ſure. And if wee will beleeve <hi>Theodoret</hi> and many others, <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>ad Graecos.</hi> it was ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <hi>partly,</hi> becauſe the people of God then were uncapable to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that depth, and <hi>partly,</hi> to prevent Idolatrie, to which ſin the Iſraëlites were very prone; for living amongſt the Egyptians, then with Cananites, and other idolatrous people that did ſurround them, and were worſhippers of many gods, if they had clearly and explicitely heard mention of God the Father, of God the Son, and God the holy Ghoſt, here is the danger, that they would have been Tritheïtes, and have beleeved that there were three gods; yet was this myſterie ſhadowed many waies in the Old Teſtament, leſt it, being ſeen in the eſſentiall image of God, and evidently preached in the Goſpel, ſhould ſeem to Chriſtians a new doctrine, or repugnant to the Old Teſtament.</p>

And it might bee the caſe of many others then, and before thoſe daies, was in a good condition for beleeving in the promiſed Meſſiah, albeit then hee pitched not his faith on the Meſſiah, as already com in the fleſh; and that was, wee may well preſume, for want of ſufficient inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, for virtually beleeving on the Meſſiah, whom hee explicitely profeſſed not; yet I ſay, that hee which is denominated a Beleever in Chriſt, and a Diſciple of the Lord Jeſus, doth not onely beleeve with his heart, but hee doth alſo profeſs with his tongue, that the Savior of the world was manifeſted in our fleſh.</p>

                     </label> To this I anſwer, that thoſe Epheſians were Diſciples and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers; for ſo the text call's them, but they were very children in knowledg at that time: they were converts, and baptized, for ſo ſaith the text, how ever Baptiſm is taken; and if properly, as it is moſt likely, either by <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, or one of his Diſciples, they were not <hi>tam tincti, quàm ſordidati,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Ambroſe:</hi> They then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home to Epheſus, and wanted means at home of further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, as wee may charitably judg, and probably gather, becauſe that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> were forbidden to preach the word of God in Aſia, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 6. where Epheſus ſtood, but afterwards, as wee may
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:114590:48"/> read, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. and 20. Chapters, the glorious light did ſhine forth to idolatrous Epheſus, by the long continued diſputations, and many Sermons of Saint <hi>Paul:</hi> ſo that in what ſenſe ſoever the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt bee taken in the queſtion and anſwer, theſe Epheſians were very much unlike to thoſe Chriſtians, which according to that <hi>ſcomma propheticum,</hi> Eſa. 65. 20. were <hi>children of an hundred years old.</hi> And, as <hi>Eſpencaeus</hi> out of his own knowledg ſaith of an ancient and noble Gentleman brought up in the Church, and ſo his ignorance was unexcuſable, that hee did freely confeſs, that hee never had heard whether there was an holy Ghoſt or not, <hi>in</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>cha digr.</hi> 17. But I will reaſon with you.</p>
                  <p>Either this ignorance of the Epheſians was vincible, or invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible; either it was ſinfull, or ſinleſs. That there was an holy Spirit of God expreſly revealed in the Old Teſtament, and by the name of the Spirit of God, yea and manifeſted by extraordinarie inſpirations and raptures, not onely by the holy Prophets, but alſo to others which had not a ſtanding calling to that high office. <hi>Saul</hi> and the Meſſengers of <hi>Saul</hi> propheſied amongſt the Prophets, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. And that hee is yet more fully revealed in the New Teſtament, you cannot denie, although you do boldly and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denie his Deitie.</p>
                  <p>Well then, if theſe Epheſians never heard of the holy Ghoſt, either it was becauſe they never had ſufficient means to inſtruct them in that profound myſterie; and do you think that this is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry probable? for they had, or might have had the writings of the Prophets; and if they were baptized by <hi>John,</hi> doth not hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſpeak of the holy Ghoſt? <hi>Christ</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>ſhould baptize with the holy Ghoſt,</hi> Matth. 3. 11. Or might they not have repaired to ſom Chriſtians in ſom place or other for a further inſtruction in the faith? Or if they never heard of the holy Ghoſt, it is elſe, becauſe albeit they had ſom means of knowledg this way, yet did they not regard them, or ſufficiently profit by them. Take it which way you will, and in neither of the waies is there any ſtrength in the Argument to prove your odious aſſertion; but it argue's clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that you are given up by the juſt judgment of God to ſtrong deluſions to beleeve lies. How could it elſe have entred into your heart to think, that the ignorance of a few untaught Chriſtians
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:114590:48"/> ſhould bee a ſound proof to overthrow a truth, which was unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly imbraced by ſounder Chriſtians? Shall God's truths bee no truths, becauſe ſom ſinfull and ignorant perſons do not know them? Nay rather, you ſhould thus have reaſoned, ſince this was a divine truth preached by <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and afterward more fully taught by Chriſt and his Apoſtles; therefore without wave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, much more without contradicting them, I will ſubmit to their better judgment.</p>

I add further, that it is clearly propheſied, that extraordinarie gifts, as of propheſying and tongues, are called the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Joël</hi> 2. 28. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 17. and in this Chapter, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 6. the holy Ghoſt came upon them: How this is to bee underſtood, the words following do expound, <hi>They ſpoke with tongues, and propheſied,</hi> Ver. 6.

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:114590:49"/> of the holy Ghoſt, that wee have not ſo much as heard whether there bee any ſuch miraculous gifts of the holy Ghoſt or not: And if the queſtion moved to them was not touching the Perſon, and ſanctifying graces of the holy Ghoſt, but onely touching miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous gifts, as 'tis moſt probable; (for they being Diſciples might bee preſumed not to bee ignorant, that there was an holy Spirit, and that hee was a Sanctifier of his ſervants) then either their anſwer is impertinent to the queſtion, or elſe they muſt needs return their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in effect thus, Wee have not heard whether there bee ſuch mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous gifts of the holy Ghoſt, or not.</p>

                  <p>Touching your Aſſertion, that the underſtanding reſide's in an eſſence, if wee ſpeak of a creäted underſtanding, you ſhall meet with contradiction to this opinion from the pens of moſt ſubtile Philoſophers, <hi>J. C.

The ſoul, the underſtanding, and the will are the ſame thing; it's called the ſoul in regard of the eſſence; the ſame eſſence is called the underſtanding, as it apprehend's an object; the ſame thing is called the will, as it extend's it ſelf to enjoy the good thing which is apprehended convenient for it. But I will not contend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this point, which if it were granted, will not weaken the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. Bee it granted, that a finite underſtanding is an accident, and really diſtinguiſhed from, and neceſſarily depending on its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; yet will it not bee verified of the infinite underſtanding of God, whoſe Eſſence is moſt ſimple without all kindes of compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:114590:51"/> from whence reſult's a thing compounded as a third thing, of it ſelf one, truly and really diſtinguiſhed from the parts thereof.

God is great without quantitie; God is good and juſt without qualitie; God is merciful without paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; God is every where preſent without place; the firſt and the laſt; without time; nor is hee compounded of Nature and Perſon, becauſe the Eſſence of God is moſt ſimple, moſt infinite, moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe, and the ſame thing is both the Nature and the Perſon: nor is this overthrown, becauſe there are three Perſons; for they are not three by compoſition of parts, for the Perſons are not many things, they are but one thing, though diſtinguiſhed by relative properties; for the divine relation in God is not properly an accident, but a ſubſtantial attribute, and make's no real compoſition in God, but a diſtinction of our reaſon, which croſſeth not the abſolute ſimplicitie of God no more then the ſame diſtinction of reaſon oppoſeth the abſolute unitie of God, becauſe this denomination is extrinſecal, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from our manner of conceiving of it, <hi>Suarez.</hi> Thus is hee <hi>Deus trinus,</hi> by co-exiſtencie of Perſons; but the Catholick Faith teacheth us, that in creatures, the nature may bee really divided from the perſon: thus the Son of God did aſſume the nature, but not the perſon of man.</p>

                     </label> The <hi>Major,</hi> Hee that hath a will diſtinct from that of God, is not God. I grant the Propoſition to bee true, if it bee taken in your ſenſe for a diſtinct and ſeparate will; for two ſuch wills do neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily require two diſtinct ſubſtances, to which they do relate.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> I denie your <hi>Minor.</hi> The holy Ghoſt hath not a will diſtinct from that of God. <hi>First,</hi> I ſay, this text doth not clearly hold forth to us any thing touching the will of God's Spirit. The originall is, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and in our new tranſlation is turned, not the will, but the minde of the Spirit. Som render it the intention of the Spirit, and others the ſpiritual ſenſe; and you know very well, that the primarie ſignification of the word is thus to bee tranſlated. God know's the intention of the Spirit, or act of the minde.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> let us grant what you cannot prove, that it is to bee tranſlated <hi>what is the will,</hi> or <hi>what is the deſire</hi> of the Spirit. To this I anſwer, that the Spirit willeth and deſireth, as hee praieth; it is a Metonymie, hee is ſaid to will and deſire, becauſe hee inableth us to will and deſire according to the will of God; God know's the intention of the Spirit, even as the Mother knoweth the crying and ſobbing of her Infant; and ſo our ſecret ſighs, which are infuſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, are known of God: our ſighs indeed cannot bee expreſſed by us, but the Spirit, which work's them in us, direct's them unto God. Apparent it is you were hard put to it to make up a ful dozen of Arguments out of an ambiguous text, to prove a diſtinct will of the Spirit from the will of God the Father, by a place where there is no convincing proof that there is any mention of the will of the Spirit at all.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Grant further, that this <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> bee the <hi>will,</hi> or what the Spirit of God deſire's by thoſe groans, yet will it not follow,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:114590:53"/> that there bee two diſtinct wills of God the Father and the Spirit. What I have written touching the underſtanding of God and of the Spirit, is by paritie of reaſon to bee applied to this Argument: there is, as I aſſerted, but one will of God the Father, and God the holy Ghoſt, but yet this one will is otherwiſe in the Father, otherwiſe in the holy Ghoſt; in the Father, of and from himſelf, but in the holy Ghoſt by eternal communication of the Deitie to him.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, whereas you talk of conformitie and agreeableneſs, which is alwaies betwixt two at the leaſt, I have anſwered the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this in the former Argument. This agreeableneſs is not properly betwixt the will of the holy Ghoſt, and of God the Father, but betwixt the will of man acted to pray by the Spirit of God, and the will of God, and theſe muſt needs bee two. To draw to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, I denie not, but agreeableneſs and equalitie are aſſcribed to the Perſons of the Trinitie; for the Jews collected, and that juſtly too, becauſe the Son of God called God his Father, hee made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf equal to God, <hi>John</hi> 5. Nor did the Son of God think hee rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed God of his honor, when hee made himſelf equal to his Father, <hi>Phil</hi> 2. And what is ſpoken of the Son, is true likewiſe of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt; and it is the general reſolution of the Church, that the holy Ghoſt is conſubſtantial, co-equal, co-omnipotent, and co-eternal with God the Father, and God the Son. Now, becauſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie is properly underſtood of quantitie, and agreeableneſs in qualitie; it will not bee amiſs to explicate briefly in what ſenſe <hi>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude</hi> and <hi>equàlitie</hi> are aſſcribed to the ſacred Perſons. It is to bee obſerved, that in regard of ſubſtance, things are ſaid to bee the ſame or divers: If the ſubſtance bee one, things are ſaid to bee <hi>one in ſubſtance;</hi> but if not the ſame ſubſtance, they are ſaid to bee divers in ſubſtance. In regard of <hi>qualitie,</hi> things are ſaid to <hi>bee like,</hi> which do agree in qualitie; and <hi>unlike,</hi> when they have not one qualitie. In regard of <hi>quantitie,</hi> they are ſaid to bee <hi>equal</hi> or <hi>unequal.</hi> Now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in God, to ſpeak properly, there is neither qualitie nor quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie, (for how ſhould a finite qualitie or quantitie reſide in an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite ſubſtance? or how is it poſſible that theſe ſhould bee many infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites?) therefore it follow's undeniably, that theſe three, <hi>viz.</hi> iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie, ſimilitude, and quantitie, are all one in God, and one God, becauſe there is the ſame eſſence and ſubſtance of the three Perſons, and yet there is ſimilitude and identitie betwixt the Perſons founded
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:114590:53"/> not on the relation betwixt them, but on the eſſence; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, becauſe there is no diſſimilitude betwixt the eſſence, there is no diſſimilitude abſolutely in the Perſons: yet it is ſo founded on the eſſence, that it doth inſinuate to us the pluralitie of the Perſons. The Perſons are ſaid to bee like, as touching qualities, becauſe they do agree in the ſame perfection of qualities: as in wiſdom, power, goodneſs, and ſuch like; theſe are really diſtinguiſhed in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but relating to God, they neither amongſt themſelvs, nor from the divine eſſence do differ really.</p>
                  <p>The Perſons in Trinitie are ſaid to bee equal, becauſe they do ſo agree in the ſame perfection, that one Perſon doth not in the leaſt degree exceed another; for there are no degrees in that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite: that is ſaid to bee better in quantitie, that is better, and hath a higher degree of excellencie then another; as in Logick, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of qualitie is quantitie, ſo that greatneſs in God is nothing elſe, but the excellencie of God in every perfection. If the firſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was more potent, and wiſer then the holy Ghoſt, there would bee likeneſs betwixt them, but not equalitie; there muſt of neceſſitie bee a diſtinction betwixt things like and equal: for nothing is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual or like to it ſelf. The Father is not the holy Ghoſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt are ſaid to bee one in eſſence, goodneſs, wiſdom, there is not in ſuch an attribution, a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Perſons; but when wee ſay, the Perſons are like or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, as touching every imaginable perfection: as in goodneſs, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, power, &amp;c. ſuch an attribution neceſſarily require's a diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Perſons amongſt themſelvs.</p>
                  <p>I have now (as I conceive) fully anſwered your twelve Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. I have ſet down all, and concealed nothing which in your Arguments carrieth with it any ſhew of ſtrength; there remaineth yet one Argument in your Epiſtle, by which you would counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance your Hereſie, in theſe words:</p>

                  <head>ANSWER.</head>
                  <p>I do willingly grant, that ſince there is a Trinitie of Perſons, there muſt of neceſſitie bee acknowledged an order amongſt them. But how? <hi>Not in regard of time,</hi> as though the holy Ghoſt ſhould bee in time after the Father, and the Son of God, for they are co-eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: <hi>nor</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> 
                     <hi>in order of nature,</hi> as if the holy Ghoſt ſhould bee in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture after God the Father, and God the Son; for in this ſenſe, that is ſaid to bee after another, which depend's upon the nature of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, which hath no place in this ſubject, becauſe the three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have but one undivided nature. <hi>Neither,</hi> in the <hi>third place, is the holy Ghoſt,</hi> to ſpeak properly, <hi>after the Father in dignitie;</hi> for there is but one Deitie, and there is equal glorie, equal majeſtie of the three Perſons: The <hi>order then is in regard of original and principle,</hi> as it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the Father as Father is the principle of the Son, and the Father and the Son are the principle of the holy Ghoſt. In this regard it is, that wee commonly ſay, the Father is the firſt Perſon of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, as being of none: The Son is the ſecond Perſon of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie from his Father. The holy Ghoſt is the third Perſon, being from eternitie both from the Father and the Son.</p>
                  <p>This conceſſion is not anſwerable to your opinion; for if you would ſpeak out of the Son, as you do of the holy Ghoſt, you hold, as appear's by many of your Arguments, both God's Son, and the holy Ghoſt to bee creatures after God in time, in nature, and in dignitie.</p>
                  <p>Whereas you ſay, this in your ſenſe is according to Scriptures, the texts which you have alledged I have diſcuſſed, and made it clear both by my poſitive Arguments in proof of the point, and by my anſwers to your Scriptures, that your <hi>tenet</hi> is directly againſt Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</p>
                  <p>But (ſay you) this is agreeable to the Fathers: this (ſay I) is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry falſly and impudently ſpoken. I am now upon the defenſive part, and will not ſet down a catalogue of their teſtimonies in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ages as I might do, and thoſe that are not learned may clearly ſee how falſly you do boaſt of the Fathers by the Apoſtolical (as it is called) the Nicene, Conſtantinopolitane, and Athanaſian Creeds.</p>

                     </label> The bleſſed Martyr, which wrote his Apologies about the year of our Lord, 162. placeth the holy Ghoſt in his ſecond Apologie in the third order, not in your ſenſe, but in that meaning which is unanimouſly acknowledged by Orthodoxal Divines; and this I prove by <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> himſelf, who poſitively aſſert's in his firſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie, that the Son of God placed by him the ſecond in order, was alone properly the Son of God, that hee was with his Father before the world was made. Now, as the Son of God, the ſecond in order, was truly God; ſo may wee argue by proportion, that the holy Ghoſt, who is the third in order, is likewiſe God. And this you might have learned by the words, which do immediatly follow in <hi>Juſtin;</hi> for, when hee had ſaid, <hi>Wee have the Prophetical Spirit in the third place,</hi> hee immediatly ſubjoin's theſe words, <hi>Wee teach that hee is rightly to bee worſhipped, which honor agree's well to God, not to a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> And in the ſame Apologie afterwards, hee would prove the Trinitie of the Perſons out of <hi>Plato.</hi> And this of the third Perſon, that it is written by <hi>Moſes</hi> of him, that hee moved (in the begining of the creation) upon the waters. And in the ſame Apologie hee relate's the cuſtom of the Church in his daies, both touching Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, that the perſon is waſhed with water (not in the names, but) in the Name of the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt. And likewiſe touching the Euchariſt (as hee call's it) when the Miniſter had taken bread and wine, hee giv's the praiſe and glorie of all things to the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt. And after the receiving the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and giving relief to the poor, the aſſembly is diſmiſſed, and (ſaith hee) in all things which wee uſe, wee praiſe God the Father of all by his Son Jeſus Chriſt through the holy Ghoſt. And in his expoſition of the Faith, touching the holy Trinitie, there is one (ſaith hee) truly the God of all, and hee is known and underſtood in the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt, and ſaith, they are of one eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and one divinitie, and much more to this effect. But this is enough.</p>
                  <p>Go now and boaſt of the Fathers in general, and of <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> in particular, and bluſh for ſhame, if there bee any modeſtie left in you, for your intolerable wrong offered to the holy Fathers, and for fathering on them that abominable Hereſie which they did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. </p>

            <p>THis Paper may fall into the hands both of the unknowing and skilfull Readers, and is liable to various cenſures.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> I do fore-ſee, that thoſe which are little verſed in theſe points will complain, that I affect obſcurities, and that they cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand my writing. I deſire them to conſider, that I do treat about the higheſt myſteries of Faith, and that it is neither fit nor ſafe for mee to change the terms which are in common uſe amongſt the learned; the danger hereof is apparent by this memorable example. <hi>Gregor Nazianz</hi> in an Oration of the praiſes of great <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> ſhew's the rents betwixt the Eaſtern and Weſtern Churches, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the uſe of theſe terms, <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> and <hi>Perſona;</hi> the Eaſtern Churches uſed the word <hi>Hypoſtaſis,</hi> and utterly diſliked the name <hi>Perſon.</hi> On the other ſide, the Weſtern Churches adhered to the name <hi>Perſon,</hi> and could not endure the name <hi>Hypoſtaſis.</hi> The Eaſtern Churches judged the Weſtern Churches to bee <hi>Sabellians, i e.</hi> that they held but one Perſon called by three names. And the Weſtern Churches judged the Eaſtern to bee <hi>Tritheites</hi> and <hi>Arians,</hi> maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing three ſubſtances. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> apprehended the miſtake, and that both ſides were ſound in the faith, though they differed in terms, and ſo reconciled them. I do intreat theſe Readers, if they meet with difficulties, that they would not preſently caſt the Book out of their hands, but to take pains to know the meaning, pray, read, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend the text, the context, and parallel places of Scriptures, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, and where your endeavors fail you, have recourſe to the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which will, if it bee needfull for you to know, reſolve your doubts, and ſomwhat clear your judgments, and to encourage you, I dare promiſe, that you ſhall not repent of your labors, but better underſtand ſom texts of Scriptures and humane Authors which handle this ſubject, then formerly you have don.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> I do fore-ſee alſo, that the judicious Reader will accuſe mee for frequent repetitions, which are little better then vain tautologies. My Apologie is, the courſe of my Adverſaries Arguments lead mee thereunto; for if I had not applied a particular anſwer to every one of them, hee would have inſulted over mee, and judged them to bee unanſwerable; that I had been like a childe, which skip's when hee

I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that this was purpoſely don to clear up doubts, and to make the diſcourſe more profitable for the Reader; for had I intended meerly to anſwer the Arguments in a Scholaſtical way, a ſhort di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction applied in a few lines might have ſerved the turn for his longeſt Argument; but then (as I conceive) I had miſſed of my end, the information of the judgment of weaker Chriſtians.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> I do ſuſpect that ſom of my learned brethren will bee diſpleaſed with mee for writing thus more then once, <hi>The holy Ghoſt, not as the holy Ghoſt, yet, as God, is of himſelf.</hi> I do confeſs, the ſtrength of my Adverſaries reaſons did not neceſſitate mee to uſe ſuch an expreſſion; and had I timely conſidered of it, both to prevent the ſeeming ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to an enemie, and the needleſs cenſure of friends, I would have forborn it.

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:114590:56"/> but as a Perſon, hee is of his Father; and this is true.

            <p>I do intreat the learned, if they do diſcover any real faults here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, (which is not unlikely; for another may ſooner ſee mine errors then I can ſee them my ſelf; and ſo perhaps may I ſee another mans, which the Author take's no ſpecial notice of) that they would in a Chriſtian manner, with ſound reaſons reform my judgment: For truly I am not in love of any error, if known, but do carrie a minde alwaies readie to renounce my judgment, and to give place to the truth in any point, when it ſhall bee manifeſted to mee.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I do earneſtly beſeech both kindes of Readers to beſtow thoſe ſpiritual alms upon mee, which are both my due to demand, and their dutie to afford mee, that they would pray to God for mee, that I may faithfully imploy that ſmall talent which the Lord hath imparted to mee, for his glorie, mine own and others benefit. All the glorie, the riches, the higheſt preferments, and all imaginable perfections in this world are but unſatisfying ſhadows, and meer pictures of happineſs; but happy, thrice happy, yea a thouſand times happy is that man, whoſe God is the Lord.</p>
            <p>I now addreſs my ſpeech to you, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Bidle:</hi> I confeſs, I can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe nothing to myſelf touching your converſion; I fear you have hardned your heart, and made it like an Adamant, uncapable of any impreſſion of this heavenly truth. You glorie, that you have diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with many learned men, and could not receive ſatisfaction from them, no not ſo much as to one of your Arguments; I do not doubt but you have heard from them the ſame anſwers which I have made, and more forcibly urged upon you then I have don; yet I do ſpeak as loud as you do, that I have examined them all, and am in mine own judgment ſatisfied in mine anſwer touching every one of them, and do confidently ſay, there is no ſtrength in any one of them to prove your deteſtable Hereſie, but they are a number of Sophiſtical fallacies, which I have plainly detected.</p>
            <p>It grieve's mee, that any one ſhould rake out of the grave old rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Hereſies, to infect the world with their ſtink, eſpecially that my Countriman ſhould, to the joy of Adverſaries, and the great diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:114590:56"/> of our Religion, vent them in print. Mee think's I ſee you, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Bidle,</hi> ſtruggling to extinguiſh that little light which is in you, in that you ſet your wits awork to pervert plain Scriptures in the end of your Book by your forced anſwers to them, which I have laid open in juſtifying of our Arguments, and (not ſo much as barely to mention our ſtrongeſt reaſons) what may wee judg to bee your meaning herein, but a conviction that you can give to them no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable anſwer at all? Doth not the Chriſtian world, in the ſucceſſion of many ages, wherein your Hereſie hath been cried down to the pit of hell, ſtrike terror into you? Doth not the conſent of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, which you have deſerted, lie as heavie as a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain upon you? Doth not your conſcience check you, for cleaving to a few rotten branches cut off from the Church, and for ſtriving in the ſtoutneſs of your ſpirit againſt the ſtream both of clear Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and the unanimous judgment of the Church of Chriſt? Can you think, that wiſdom ſhould bee with you, and follie with them all? Conſider, I pray, that you have ſet yourſelf againſt a ſtrong Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſarie, hee cannot bee reſiſted, hee will prevail over you. Yield up then your weapons in time unto him, give glorie to his great Name, and put forth all your ſtrength for time to com, to bring honor to his greatneſs, as you have been a diveliſh inſtrument to defie ſupreme Majeſtie: it is <hi>a happy victorie to bee conquered of Truth.</hi>
